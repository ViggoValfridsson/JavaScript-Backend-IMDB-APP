- When searching you will be shown a dropdown of autocompleted guesses. If you submit the search you will be taken to the search result page which displays both movie and TV shows matching your query.
- After clicking on a movie/TV show you will be shown additional information about it. The page shows the rating, runtime, title, trailer/other videos, genres, description and crew.
